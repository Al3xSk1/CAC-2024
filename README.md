# Congressional App Challenge 2024

## The Idea

Having a hard time in high school is expected, you are not alone. Being a high school student myself, it is really hard to find oportunities in STEM. I signed up for LinkedIn on my 16th birthday (the minimum age for LinkedIn), and had a hard time finding opportunities in STEM around me.

For my Congressional App Challenge 2024 app, I want to create a website detailing of STEM opportunities around me to help students explore the opportunities of STEM. If you have an activity you would like to list on the website please fill out this form. [Click Here to Submit](https://forms.gle/DnKKesMtrsz53qEd9).
