    <p>Certifications are a great way to show mastery and experience in technology. Many certifications cost money, while some may see this as a way of life, others remain priced out of certifications. As an altenative to paid for certifications I reccommend IBM SkillsBuild. It is a free online learning platform that can teach about anything from the benefits of open source to cloud computing with AI to Project Management.</p>

    <p>If you do have money and are looking into obtaining certifications look for student discounts at certification vendors. CompTIA, an IT certification provider, offers significant discounts to students including high school students. I reccommend the CompTIA IT Fundamentals+ as a intro paid for certification.</p>
