    <h2>Robotics</h2>
    <p>If you are more of a hands-on person who is interested in tech. I reccommend starting a FIRST Robotics Competion (FRC) Team or FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) Team. I am a member of my schools's FRC Team, I strongly reccommend it if you have the time.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FTC Website</a></p>
    <h2>E-Sports</h2>
    <p>At my high school, we have an E-Sports club/team. Students are able to play games together cooperatively or competitively. Games which we have at our school include Minecraft, Roblox, Overwatch, Steam, etc...</p>
    <h2>Programming Club</h2>
    <p>If your school has a big interest in Computer Science, I reccommend starting a Computer Science club. You may be able to create a website for your school or create a blog for your schools newspaper.</p>
    <h2>Game Development Club</h2>
    <p>Many students like playing games, but what about building them software like the Godot Game Engine, Roblox Studio, Unity, and the Unreal Game Engine have made game development easier than ever before. Why not start a club?</p>
    <h2>Film Club</h2>
    <p>Film Club allows students to learn about camera and video technologies as well as editing software. Many high-schools already have film teams that get paid such as my own. It is a great way to make income while in school and a great thing to add to your resume.</p>
    <h2>Computer Science Honor Society</h2>
    <p>The Computer Science Honor Society (CSHS) is national organization which promotes Computer Science in high-schools around the US. The CSHS requires that an advisor be a member of the Computr Science Teacxher Asssociation (CSTA) with a $50 per year membership fee. If that seems unattainable for some school districts have your elligible students create a fundraiser to get $50 to pay for the membership fee. You might make more than you think!</p>
    <h2>Programming Union</h2>
    <p>A Programming Union is a project based club where you sell services to local businesses or build them websites, basic apps, or many other projects. This club creates real world experiences for students and allows them to better equip themselves for a future career in Computers.</p>
