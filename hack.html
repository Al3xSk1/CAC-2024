    <p>Hackathons are a fun way to build project, some even have prizes! I attended a hackathon at Boston University (BU) in Boston, MA. Although I did not win, I had a great time. My friend won 2 Amazon Echo(s) for his participation. I strongly reccommend trying to find hackathons near you or organizing a hackathon for your school's computer science / programming club. If you don't have one check out our guide on our <a href="club.html">Clubs</a> page.</p>
