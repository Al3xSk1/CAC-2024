    <p>Internships are a great way to show experience in anything. It is very hard to find internships targeted toward high-school students especially if you are not a senior. In my high-school, my teacher told me "it is such a shame that people have to pay for internships, think of the inequity." </p>
    <p>I have completed 2 internships while in high-school. Both of which from a small company, which thanks to them, I was able to make some income fully remote. Shoutout to the Work-Based Learning Alliance.</p>

    <p>If your school has an IT department, ask them if they would be interested in summer internships or after-school internships for volunteering or even pay!</p>
    <p>If by any chance you would like to list your internship or an internship that is equitable please follow the link on our <a href="index.html">Home</a> Page.</p>
    <p>The following internships are listed in no particular order.</p>
