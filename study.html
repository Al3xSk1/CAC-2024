    <h2>High-School Education</h2>
    <p>In high-school, there are many ways to get learn about technology. College Board offers 2 AP classes for Computer Science: AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) and AP Computer Science A (AP CSA). AP CSP is a introductory course based primarily in Python. While AP CSA is a higher level course based entirely in Java.</p>
    <p>Your school may also have additional classes in Cybersecurity, web development, or game development. If you have the option to take the class and are interested in having a career in IT, I would strongly recommend doing so.</p>
    <h2>College Education</h2>
    <p>There are many technical schools in the US and around the world. I will list some schools which reside in the US or Canada indicated by (*).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>California Institute of Technology</li>
        <li>Clarkson University </li>
        <li>Georgia Institute of Technology </li>
        <li>Kettering University </li>
        <li>Massachusetts Institute of Technology </li>
        <li>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute </li>
        <li>Rochester Institute of Technology </li>
        <li>Texas Tech University </li>
        <li>University of Waterloo*</li>
        <li>Worcester Polytechnic Institute </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>Learning about technology and how to utilize it is hard. There are some great sites to learn about tech. In our certifications page, there is a link to IBM SkillsBuild a free online learning platform with free certifications.</p>
    <p>At my school in AP CSA we use a free platform to learn Java, it is called CSAwesome by Runestone Academy. I highly recommend it.</p>

    <p>I was recommended to sign up for LinkedIn Learning in 2023. Although it is priced at $40 per month, it is publicly accessible with most library cards. For example, Boston Public Library offers free access to LinkedIn Learning by simply entering the library's prefix, library card number, and pin into the website.</p>
